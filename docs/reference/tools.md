| `easyeda_bom_export`                    | `core`  | `low`    | Export the bill of materials to a file on disk in the specified format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `easyeda_bom_generate`                  | `core`  | `low`    | Generate a bill of materials for the project with grouping and formatting options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `easyeda_bom_quality_report`            | `core`  | `medium` | Generate a BOM quality report that identifies unavailable, single-source, missing-MPN, missing-footprint, and low-stock items across configured suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `easyeda_bom_sourcing`                  | `core`  | `medium` | Retrieve pricing and availability information for all parts in the project BOM from specified suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `easyeda_bom_validate`                  | `core`  | `medium` | Validate the project BOM against LCSC inventory to identify missing, obsolete, or alternate parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `easyeda_bridge_probe_methods`          | `dev`   | `medium` | Query the EasyEDA Pro bridge for available API methods. Requires bridge connection. (dev/pro only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `easyeda_bridge_status`                 | `core`  | `low`    | Check EasyEDA Pro bridge connection status, version, and capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `easyeda_canvas_capture`                | `core`  | `low`    | Capture the currently visible EasyEDA schematic/PCB canvas as a PNG image, so the caller can visually verify the result of a draw/place/route action. Captures the given tab (or the last-focused one) as-is; use easyeda_canvas_capture_region first to frame a specific area.                                                  |
| `easyeda_canvas_capture_region`         | `core`  | `low`    | Zoom the EasyEDA canvas to a rectangular region (document/canvas coordinates) and capture it as a PNG, so the caller can visually verify a specific area. This moves the user's visible viewport — EasyEDA Pro has no offscreen rendering API.                                                                                   |
| `easyeda_canvas_locate`                 | `core`  | `low`    | Zoom the EasyEDA canvas to a coordinate/scale (document/canvas coordinates), returning the resulting viewport rectangle. Useful to frame a location before calling easyeda_canvas_capture, or standalone to navigate the user's view to a point of interest.                                                                     |
| `easyeda_catalog_list`                  | `pro`   | `low`    | List devices cached by easyeda_catalog_verify_device, with their validation status and provenance. Optionally filter by status (resolved/partial/unresolved). This is a local cache only — never redistributed.                                                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_catalog_verify_device`         | `pro`   | `medium` | Resolve an LCSC part number into a catalog device entry (keyless LCSC metadata plus an EasyEDA symbol/footprint reference, if already known locally), validate it, and write it to the local device cache (confirmWrite required). Does NOT verify pin/pad geometry — see docs/catalog-ingestion.md.                             |
| `easyeda_component_probe`               | `dev`   | `low`    | Inspect live schematic component objects, including available methods and state getter values, to validate EasyEDA runtime mappings.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `easyeda_design_rules_lookup`           | `core`  | `low`    | Look up generic engineering reference guidance: IPC-2221 trace-width/current-capacity, clearance bands, protocol routing data (USB/RS-485/I2C/SPI/UART/Ethernet), decoupling recipes and bulk capacitance sizing, and a static DFM checklist. Every result cites a source and caveat: these are estimates, not certified values. |
| `easyeda_drc_run`                       | `core`  | `medium` | Run the native design rule check (DRC): same as clicking "Check DRC" in EasyEDA Pro, so the bottom DRC panel opens/refreshes in the user's window as a visible side effect. Returns coarse per-severity counts only — which specific wire/net/component is affected is shown only in EasyEDA Pro's own DRC panel.                |
| `easyeda_erc_run`                       | `core`  | `medium` | Run the native electrical rule check (ERC). Native counts are coarse; inferred_floating_pins supplements them with located, unconnected pins from this bridge's own inference (best-effort — other categories still need the DRC panel).                                                                                         |
| `easyeda_export_gerbers`                | `core`  | `medium` | Export PCB design to Gerber files for PCB fabrication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `easyeda_export_netlist`                | `pro`   | `low`    | Export the schematic netlist in a specified EDA tool format (PADS, Allegro, or Altium).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `easyeda_export_pdf`                    | `pro`   | `low`    | Export the schematic and/or board layout to PDF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `easyeda_export_pick_place`             | `pro`   | `low`    | Export pick-and-place (centroid) file for PCB assembly. Contains component reference, position, rotation, and layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `easyeda_get_capabilities`              | `core`  | `low`    | Return server capabilities, including available profiles, enabled feature flags, and supported operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `easyeda_get_server_config`             | `core`  | `low`    | Return safe (redacted) server configuration. Secrets are never exposed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `easyeda_health_check`                  | `core`  | `low`    | Return server health status in one call: runtime version, active profile, bridge state, EasyEDA version, keyless sourcing state, and starter catalog size. Intended as the single actionable status check after first connecting the bridge extension.                                                                           |
| `easyeda_jlcpcb_quote_workflow`         | `pro`   | `medium` | Prepare a non-binding JLCPCB quote workflow snapshot with explicit human-review gates and audit evidence. This tool never places orders or performs paid operations.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `easyeda_live_smoke_report`             | `dev`   | `low`    | Run a read-only live smoke report against the connected EasyEDA bridge and return status, API inventory, components, wires, and schematic nets in one response.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_observability_report`          | `core`  | `low`    | Return latency budgets, runtime metrics, cache/vendor timing snapshot, and storage retention policy for performance diagnostics.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `easyeda_pcb_add_track`                 | `full`  | `high`   | Draw a copper track/trace on the PCB board. A multi-point path is written as one line segment per consecutive point pair (all sharing netName, so they form one electrical track — same coordinate/name merge model as schematic wires).                                                                                         |
| `easyeda_pcb_add_via`                   | `full`  | `high`   | Place a via to connect different copper layers on the PCB board. outerDiameter/holeSize are passed through to the native API unconverted (same native unit as x/y) — their real-world scale was not independently verified against a known physical dimension, so confirm the resulting via size visually before trusting it.    |
| `easyeda_pcb_add_zone`                  | `full`  | `high`   | Create a copper pour zone on a layer with clearance settings. CAUTION: the native create() call needs 9 args but this tool sends only 4 (points, layer, netName, clearance) — live-confirmed mismatch, not yet resolved. Verify visually before trusting it.                                                                     |
| `easyeda_pcb_autoroute`                 | `pro`   | `high`   | Drive EasyEDA Pro's native autorouter (PCB_Document.autoRouting, a @beta API) after a pre-flight constraint check, then run DRC and a constraint report before reporting success. Never reports success without that evidence attached (confirmWrite required).                                                                  |
| `easyeda_pcb_components`                | `core`  | `low`    | List components placed on the active PCB layout: primitiveId, designator, footprint identity, position/rotation/layer. Requires a focused PCB tab in EasyEDA Pro — returns an empty list (not an error) if none is active.                                                                                                       |
| `easyeda_pcb_constraint_check`          | `core`  | `low`    | Run PCB constraint validation against the board design. Checks board outline, layer stackup, net classes, clearance rules, keepout areas, placement zones, mounting holes, fiducials, and manufacturing constraints.                                                                                                             |
| `easyeda_pcb_constraint_report`         | `core`  | `low`    | Generate a human-readable report explaining which PCB constraints were applied and which require manual review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_pcb_delete_component`          | `full`  | `high`   | Delete components, tracks, vias, or other PCB primitives by ID. Checks each id against every deletable PCB class instead of assuming component, since PCB_PrimitiveComponent.delete() reports success for ids it does not own without deleting them.                                                                             |
| `easyeda_pcb_export_route_context`      | `pro`   | `low`    | Export the board as a Specctra DSN file (PCB_ManufactureData.getDsnFile) — an open, vendor-neutral format supported by external autorouters such as FreeRouting. Re-import the routed result through EasyEDA Pro's own SES/DSN import, not through this server.                                                                  |
| `easyeda_pcb_floorplan`                 | `full`  | `high`   | Translate CircuitIR physical constraints (keepouts, top/bottom side, connector-edge, thermal spacing) into a component group placement plan, then optionally apply it. CircuitIR devices carry no physical dimensions, so widths/heights must be supplied per device (confirmWrite required).                                    |
| `easyeda_pcb_modify_component`          | `full`  | `high`   | Modify component properties in the PCB layout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `easyeda_pcb_place_component`           | `full`  | `high`   | Place a component footprint on the active PCB layout. CAUTION: the native create() call needs 6 args but this tool sends only 5 (footprint, x, y, rotation, layer) — live-confirmed mismatch, not yet resolved. Verify placement visually before trusting it.                                                                    |
| `easyeda_pcb_place_component_group`     | `full`  | `high`   | Create a high-level, constraint-checked placement plan for a group of components and optionally apply it after explicit confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `easyeda_pcb_production_review`         | `core`  | `medium` | Run fabrication, assembly, and testability production review rules for PCB handoff. Reports severity-ranked DFM/DFA/DFT findings with actionable remediation before Gerber export or manufacturing submission.                                                                                                                   |
| `easyeda_pcb_route_path_plan`           | `full`  | `high`   | Create a high-level, constraint-checked route path plan for one net and optionally apply it after explicit confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `easyeda_pcb_tracks`                    | `core`  | `low`    | List copper track segments on the active PCB layout: primitiveId, net, layer, start/end coordinates, width. A multi-point track drawn by add_track appears as several consecutive segments sharing one net. Returns an empty list (not an error) if no PCB tab is focused.                                                       |
| `easyeda_pcb_vias`                      | `core`  | `low`    | List vias on the active PCB layout: primitiveId, net, position, hole/outer diameter (native unit, same scale as x/y — not independently verified against a known physical dimension). Requires a focused PCB tab — returns an empty list (not an error) if none is active.                                                       |
| `easyeda_power_tree_analyze`            | `core`  | `medium` | Analyze supply sources, regulators, loads, protection, bulk capacitance, current budget, dropout, and regulator thermal risk. Returns machine-readable issues and a human-readable summary.                                                                                                                                      |
| `easyeda_production_qa_artifacts`       | `pro`   | `low`    | Generate testpoint checklist, assembly notes, bring-up plan, production QA checklist, and machine-readable QA manifest for board handoff.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `easyeda_project_save`                  | `core`  | `medium` | Explicitly save the current EasyEDA Pro project. This ensures all netlist changes, net flags, pin connections, and other mutations are persisted to the project file. Save is never implicit — the caller must explicitly request it. Requires confirmWrite.                                                                     |
| `easyeda_rule_check_summary`            | `core`  | `low`    | Get a summary of all design and electrical rule check results for the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `easyeda_run_self_test`                 | `core`  | `low`    | Run internal self-test to verify server integrity, config, and bridge connectivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `easyeda_schematic_add_wire`            | `core`  | `medium` | Add a wire connecting schematic coordinates/pins — real native connectivity. Same `netName` connects pins globally: separate stubs sharing one name merge into one net (no label needed). NET_COLLISION guards touched points against a foreign net's wire, pin, or flag/port — not mid-segment crossings.                       |
| `easyeda_schematic_component_pins`      | `core`  | `low`    | Get exact pin numbers, names, and coordinates for a schematic component by its primitive ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `easyeda_schematic_components`          | `core`  | `low`    | List schematic components: primitiveId, reference, value, footprint, x/y/rotation, and device identity for cloning — deviceUuid+deviceLibraryUuid (a place_component deviceItem in this project), deviceName, symbolName, lcsc, manufacturerId.                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_schematic_connect_pin_to_net`  | `core`  | `medium` | Create real EasyEDA connectivity for a pin: draws a short wire stub from its exact coordinate, tagged with netName. Same-netName wires merge globally, so this joins the pin to everything else on that net — visible to ERC, ratsnest, and autorouting.                                                                         |
| `easyeda_schematic_connect_pins_by_net` | `core`  | `medium` | Bulk variant of connect_pin_to_net: draws a real wire stub from each pin, tagged with netName, so all listed pins (and anything else already on that net) merge into one net. Visible to ERC, ratsnest, and autorouting. A pin that fails (e.g. collision) is reported in failures rather than aborting the batch.               |
| `easyeda_schematic_create_net_flag`     | `core`  | `medium` | Create a named net flag/label. With `identification` (Power/Ground/AnalogGround/ProtectGround) it places a power-flag symbol binding to a coincident pin (use for VCC/GND). Without it, a generic net label — cosmetic only; connect pins with add_wire stubs sharing one netName.                                               |
| `easyeda_schematic_create_net_port`     | `core`  | `medium` | Place a hierarchical net port (off-sheet connector) on the schematic. Net ports create named connections that span multiple schematic sheets, appearing as real SCH_Net entries in the netlist.                                                                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_schematic_delete_primitive`    | `core`  | `medium` | Delete components, wires, or other drawing objects from the schematic by their primitive UUIDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `easyeda_schematic_modify_primitive`    | `core`  | `medium` | Modify a schematic component/object: only fields in property change; others are read back and preserved, so partial updates never wipe unrelated data. Also moves net flags/ports — pass x/y, rotation 0/90/180/270, or mirror to shift a VCC/GND flag label off a crowded pin, keeping it over its wire.                        |
| `easyeda_schematic_net_detail`          | `core`  | `low`    | Get full details for a specific net in the schematic including all connected pins and components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `easyeda_schematic_nets`                | `core`  | `low`    | List all nets in the schematic with their node connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `easyeda_schematic_place_component`     | `core`  | `medium` | Place a library component/device on the active schematic sheet. The bridge auto-assigns the next free designator ("R?" → "R1", "R2", …); check the returned designator. If annotation fails, fix the placeholder via modify_primitive — the netlist keys nodes by designator, so duplicate "R?" merge into one node.             |

| `easyeda_schematic_validate_netlist`    | `core`  | `low`    | Validate the schematic netlist: inferred nets, connected refs/pins, floating pins, plus a cross-check with native ERC (native_erc). `valid` needs BOTH the inference clean AND native ERC 0 errors — inference alone false-positives when pins overlap without a wire.                                                           |

| `easyeda_workflow_place_block`          | `pro`   | `medium` | Place a group of components, wire their pin-to-net connections (new and/or pre-existing components), and create net ports for block-external nets — all as a single atomic transaction with rollback on partial failure (confirmWrite required).                                                                                 |
| `easyeda_workflow_power_rail`           | `pro`   | `medium` | Place a regulator and its supporting passives and wire them to input/output/ground nets in a single atomic transaction, instead of one primitive call per component. Caller supplies already-resolved device items and pin connections; this tool does not select parts (confirmWrite required).                                 |

## `easyeda_schematic_connect_pin_to_net`

**Profile:** `core` | **Risk Level:** `medium`

> Create real EasyEDA connectivity for a pin: draws a short wire stub from its exact coordinate, tagged with netName. Same-netName wires merge globally, so this joins the pin to everything else on that net — visible to ERC, ratsnest, and autorouting.

### Input Parameters

## `easyeda_schematic_connect_pins_by_net`

**Profile:** `core` | **Risk Level:** `medium`

> Bulk variant of connect_pin_to_net: draws a real wire stub from each pin, tagged with netName, so all listed pins (and anything else already on that net) merge into one net. Visible to ERC, ratsnest, and autorouting. A pin that fails (e.g. collision) is reported in failures rather than aborting the batch.
